Simsopt documentation
=====================

``simsopt`` is a system for optimizing `stellarators
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellarator>`_.  The high-level
routines are in python, with calls to C++ or fortran where needed for
performance. Several types of components are included:

- Interfaces to physics codes, e.g. for MHD equilibrium.
- Tools for defining objective functions and parameter spaces for
  optimization.
- Geometric objects that are important for stellarators: surfaces and
  electromagnetic coils.
- Tools for parallelized finite-difference gradient calculations.

Some of the physics modules with compiled code reside in separate
repositories. These separate modules include

- `VMEC <https://github.com/hiddenSymmetries/VMEC2000>`_, for MHD
  equilibrium.
- `SPEC <https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/SPEC>`_, for MHD
  equilibrium. (This repository is private.)
- `booz_xform <https://github.com/hiddenSymmetries/booz_xform>`_, for
  Boozer coordinates and quasisymmetry.
  
The design of ``simsopt`` is guided by several principles:

- Thorough unit testing, regression testing, and continuous
  integration.
- Extensibility: It should be possible to add new codes and terms to
  the objective function without editing modules that already work,
  i.e. the `open-closed principle
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open%E2%80%93closed_principle>`_
  . This is because any edits to working code can potentially introduce bugs.
- Modularity: Physics modules that are not needed for your
  optimization problem do not need to be installed. For instance, to
  optimize SPEC equilibria, the VMEC module need not be installed.
- Flexibility: The components used to define an objective function can
  be re-used for applications other than standard optimization. For
  instance, a ``simsopt`` objective function is a standard python
  function that can be plotted, passed to optimization packages
  outside of ``simsopt``, etc.

``simsopt`` was originally begun as part of the `Hidden symmetries and
fusion energy project <https://hiddensymmetries.princeton.edu>`_.  It
is fully open-source, and anyone is welcome to make suggestions,
contribute, and use.

``simsopt`` is one of several available systems for stellarator
optimization.  Others include `STELLOPT
<https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/STELLOPT>`_, `ROSE
<https://doi.org/10.1088/1741-4326/aaed50>`_, and `LASSO
<https://gitlab.com/wistell>`_.
