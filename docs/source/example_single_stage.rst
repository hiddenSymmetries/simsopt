Single stage optimization
============================

In this tutorial it is shown how to optimize the boundary shape of a
VMEC configuration to achieve quasisymmetry at the same time that the
shape of coils are optimized to reproduce the VMEC field. The approach
employed here follows the work in the paper `arXiv:2302.10622
<https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.10622>`__.
