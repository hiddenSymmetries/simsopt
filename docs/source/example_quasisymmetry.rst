Optimizing for quasisymmetry
============================

In this tutorial it is shown how to optimize the boundary shape of a
VMEC configuration to achieve quasisymmetry.  Several variants of this
problem are shown here, including both quasi-helical symmetry and
quasi-axisymmetry.  There are two objective functions available in
simsopt to achieve quasisymmetry, and both are demonstrated here.  One
objective function is
:obj:`simsopt.mhd.QuasisymmetryRatioResidual`, based
on the fact that :math:`(\vec{B}\times\nabla B
\cdot\nabla\psi)/(\vec{B}\cdot\nabla B)` is a flux function in
quasisymmetry, demonstrated in the paper `arXiv:2108.03711
<https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.03711>`__.  The other objective function,
using :obj:`simsopt.mhd.Quasisymmetry`, is a more traditional
one based on the Fourier modes in Boozer coordinates :math:`B_{m,n}`
that break the symmetry. The recommended approach is to use
:obj:`~simsopt.mhd.QuasisymmetryRatioResidual`, since
it has the modest advantage of not requiring a transformation to
Boozer coordinates, although both methods are effective. The first two
examples on this page do not require the ``booz_xform`` package,
whereas the third example does.

For these optimization examples, you probably want to write a script
that is submitted to the queue on a computing cluster, where they are
likely to take minutes or tens of minutes on one node.



Fixed resolution
----------------

..
   This example was run on IPP-Cobra in /ptmp/mlan/20211217-01-simsopt_docs_tutorials/20211217-01-001_QH_fixed_resolution
   The final configuration is also available at
   ~/Box Sync/work21/wout_20211217-01-001_simsopt_docs_tutorials_nfp4_QH_warm_start_000_000038.nc

This example is also available as ``QH_fixed_resolution.py`` in the
``examples/2_Intermediate`` directory.  As usual, a driver script begins with
imports of the classes and functions we will need::

  import numpy as np
  from simsopt.util import MpiPartition
  from simsopt.mhd import Vmec, QuasisymmetryRatioResidual
  from simsopt.objectives import LeastSquaresProblem
  from simsopt.solve import least_squares_mpi_solve

For this problem we will want MPI for parallelized finite difference
gradients. As explained below, this particular problem has 24
independent variables, so we can take advantage of 24 + 1 = 25 concurrent
function evaluations for one-sided differences. It is therefore
optimal to divide the MPI processes into 25 worker groups. For more
information about MPI and worker groups, see :doc:`mpi` or
:obj:`~simsopt.util.MpiPartition`.  In our script, we therefore
use::

  mpi = MpiPartition(25)

It is not necessary to use 25 groups - the code will function properly
for any choice.  If you select more than 25 groups, the groups beyond
the 25th will sit idle. If you select fewer than 25 groups, the 25
function evaluations needed for a finite difference gradient will be
distributed among the groups that are available.  There is no need to
make the number of groups a multiple of the number of available MPI
processes, although there cannot be more groups than processes.

We next initialize a VMEC object from an input file::

  vmec = Vmec("input.nfp4_QH_warm_start", mpi=mpi)

This file can be found in the ``examples/2_Intermediate/inputs``
directory. The file describes a configuration that has already been
partially optimized for quasi-helical symmetry in a very small
parameter space, keeping poloidal and toroidal mode numbers (the
latter divided by the number of field periods) only up through 1:

.. image:: example_quasisymmetry_QH_before.png
   :width: 400

In the present example we will refine the configuration by optimizing
in a larger parameter space, with poloidal and toroidal mode numbers
up through 2. To define this parameter space, we set the ``fixed``
property of the boundary's Fourier modes as follows::

  # Define parameter space:
  surf = vmec.boundary
  surf.fix_all()
  max_mode = 2
  surf.fixed_range(mmin=0, mmax=max_mode,
                   nmin=-max_mode, nmax=max_mode, fixed=False)
  surf.fix("rc(0,0)") # Major radius

The above code first fixes all modes of the boundary, since we want
the mode numbers greater than 2 to all be fixed. Then the desired
range of modes is set to be not fixed. This range includes the m=n=0
mode which is essentially the mean major radius. We don't need or want
to vary the overall scale of the configuration, so it is convenient to
remove this mode from the parameter space. To confirm which modes will
be varied, you can print out the names of the free degrees of freedom
(dofs)::

  print('Parameter space:', surf.dof_names)

The result is

.. code-block::

   Parameter space: ['SurfaceRZFourier1:rc(0,1)', 'SurfaceRZFourier1:rc(0,2)',
   'SurfaceRZFourier1:rc(1,-2)', 'SurfaceRZFourier1:rc(1,-1)',
   'SurfaceRZFourier1:rc(1,0)', 'SurfaceRZFourier1:rc(1,1)',
   'SurfaceRZFourier1:rc(1,2)', 'SurfaceRZFourier1:rc(2,-2)',
   'SurfaceRZFourier1:rc(2,-1)', 'SurfaceRZFourier1:rc(2,0)',
   'SurfaceRZFourier1:rc(2,1)', 'SurfaceRZFourier1:rc(2,2)',
   'SurfaceRZFourier1:zs(0,1)', 'SurfaceRZFourier1:zs(0,2)',
   'SurfaceRZFourier1:zs(1,-2)', 'SurfaceRZFourier1:zs(1,-1)',
   'SurfaceRZFourier1:zs(1,0)', 'SurfaceRZFourier1:zs(1,1)',
   'SurfaceRZFourier1:zs(1,2)', 'SurfaceRZFourier1:zs(2,-2)',
   'SurfaceRZFourier1:zs(2,-1)', 'SurfaceRZFourier1:zs(2,0)',
   'SurfaceRZFourier1:zs(2,1)', 'SurfaceRZFourier1:zs(2,2)']

Next, we need to configure a term in the objective function to
represent the departure from quasisymmetry. This can be done as
follows::

  # Configure quasisymmetry objective:
  qs = QuasisymmetryRatioResidual(vmec,
                                  np.arange(0, 1.01, 0.1),  # Radii to target
				  helicity_m=1, helicity_n=-1)  # (M, N) you want in |B|

There are several adjustable options, the details of which can be
found in the API documentation for
:obj:`~simsopt.mhd.QuasisymmetryRatioResidual`.
There you can also find the mathematical expression for the objective
function.  The second argument to
:obj:`~simsopt.mhd.QuasisymmetryRatioResidual` above
sets the quasisymmetry objective to be evaluated at a uniform grid of
11 surfaces ``[0, 0.1, 0.2, ..., 1]`` in the normalized toroidal flux
:math:`s`, with the result that quasisymmetry is targeted throughout
the volume.  You are free to provide different values, or a single
float if you only want to target quasisymmetry on a single
surface. There is also an optional argument ``weights`` if you wish to
have different weights in the objective function for quasisymmetry on
different surfaces. The ``helicity_n`` argument can also be set to
``+1`` rather than ``-1`` for quasi-helical symmetry, amounting to a
mirror-reversal, though the initial configuration used here is
consistent with the ``-1`` handedness.

We are now ready to define the total objective function. Here we will
include quasisymmetry and aspect ratio. Aspect ratio must be included
because otherwise quasisymmetry can be made arbitrarily good by
increasing the aspect ratio to infinity. The simsopt objective
function is defined as follows::

  # Define objective function
  prob = LeastSquaresProblem.from_tuples([(vmec.aspect, 7, 1),
                                          (qs.residuals, 0, 1)])

It can be seen that we are targeting an aspect ratio of 7. This
objective function will be a sum of 44,353 least-squares terms, 44,352
of which correspond to the quasisymmetry residual on 63x64 grid points
on the 11 flux surfaces targeted, plus one additional term
``(vmec.aspect - 7) ** 2``. (The 63x64 resolution is a default in
:obj:`~simsopt.mhd.QuasisymmetryRatioResidual`.)  This
large number of residual terms is no problem - it introduces
negligible computational cost compared to the cost of the equilibrium
calculations, so we may as well use this high resolution.

You can check the value of the objective functions before the
optimization. Rather than print each residual term, the scalar total
for the quasisymmetry term can be obtained with the ``.total()``
method.

.. code-block::

   print("Quasisymmetry objective before optimization:", qs.total())
   print("Total objective before optimization:", prob.objective())

The results are both 0.304, since the aspect ratio term is negligible.

Finally, we solve the optimization problem::

  least_squares_mpi_solve(prob, mpi, grad=True)

Suppose you have written the above commands in a file named
``simsopt_driver``.  Depending on your computing system, the script
can be run using a command like ``srun python simsopt_driver`` (for
SLURM systems) or ``mpirun -n 25 simsopt_driver``.

Since this objective function has multiple local minima, the final
result of the optimization can be sensitive to small changes in
simsopt, VMEC, or the packages they depend on. Therefore you will not
necessarily obtain exactly the result shown here. But one result
produced by this optimization script is the following configuration:

This last figure shows that reasonably good quasisymmetry has been
achieved. The quality of quasisymmetry can be improved significantly
by further refining the configuration using one or more rounds of
optimization with more Fourier modes in the parameter space. Printing
``qs.total()`` or ``prob.objective()`` at the end of the optimization,
it can be seen that both have been reduced significantly, to 0.00794
for the result shown here.


Dynamic resolution
------------------
..
   This example was run on IPP-Cobra in /ptmp/mlan/20211217-01-simsopt_docs_tutorials/20211217-01-003_QA_dynamic_resolution
   The final configuration is also available at
   ~/Box Sync/work21/wout_20211217-01-003_simsopt_docs_tutorials_QA_dynamic_resolution_000_000205.nc

Since simsopt optimization problems are defined using a python script,
you are free to add other scripting in your problem definition. Here
we show how this capability can be used to increase the numerical
resolution of codes such as VMEC during the optimization. At the same
time, we will increase the number of Fourier modes in the parameter
space during the optimization. This example can also be found in the
``examples/2_Intermediate`` directory as
``resolution_increase.py``. This example is very similar to the
quasi-axisymmetry optimization shown in `arXiv:2108.03711
<https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.03711>`__.

As usual, we begin with the necessary imports::

  import numpy as np
  from simsopt.util import MpiPartition
  from simsopt.mhd import Vmec, QuasisymmetryRatioResidual
  from simsopt.objectives import LeastSquaresProblem
  from simsopt.solve import least_squares_mpi_solve

We again split the pool of MPI processes into worker groups. Here, for
simplicity, we make each process its own worker group, by omitting the
argument::

  mpi = MpiPartition()

We initialize a VMEC configuration from an input file. This starting
configuration is axisymmetric with a circular cross-section, so we are
starting "from scratch"::

  vmec = Vmec("input.nfp2_QA", mpi=mpi)

This input file can be found in the ``examples/2_Intermediate/inputs``
directory. We define the quasisymmetry objective as in the previous
section, except that we specify a helicity of (1,0) instead of (1,1)
or (1,-1) to get quasi-axisymmetry instead of quasi-helical symmetry::

  # Configure quasisymmetry objective:
  qs = QuasisymmetryRatioResidual(vmec,
                                  np.arange(0, 1.01, 0.1),  # Radii to target
				  helicity_m=1, helicity_n=0)  # (M, N) you want in |B|
				  
We now define the total objective function. For this example, it is
necessary to include a nonzero target value for the rotational
transform in the objective, to prevent the optimum from being truly
axisymmetric::

  # Define objective function
  prob = LeastSquaresProblem.from_tuples([(vmec.aspect, 6, 1),
                                          (vmec.mean_iota, 0.42, 1),
                                          (qs, 0, 1)])

It can be seen here that we are seeking a configuration with aspect
ratio 6, and average iota of 0.42, slightly above the resonance at 2 /
5 = 0.4. The function :func:`simsopt.mhd.Vmec.mean_iota()` used
here returns :math:`\int_0^1 \iota\, ds` where :math:`s` is the
toroidal flux normalized by its value at the VMEC boundary.

Now, we set up a loop over several optimization steps. At each step,
the resolution parameters ``mpol`` and ``ntor`` for VMEC increase. At
the same time, in each optimization step a larger range of poloidal
and toroidal mode numbers are set to be varied in the optimization::

  for step in range(4):
      max_mode = step + 1
    
      # VMEC's mpol & ntor will be 3, 4, 5, 6:
      vmec.indata.mpol = 3 + step
      vmec.indata.ntor = vmec.indata.mpol
    
      if mpi.proc0_world:
          print("Beginning optimization with max_mode =", max_mode, \
                ", vmec mpol=ntor=", vmec.indata.mpol, \
                ". Previous vmec iteration = ", vmec.iter)

      # Define parameter space:
      surf.fix_all()
      surf.fixed_range(mmin=0, mmax=max_mode, 
                       nmin=-max_mode, nmax=max_mode, fixed=False)
      surf.fix("rc(0,0)") # Major radius

      # Carry out the optimization for this step:
      least_squares_mpi_solve(prob, mpi, grad=True)

      if mpi.proc0_world:
          print("Done optimization with max_mode =", max_mode, \
                ". Final vmec iteration = ", vmec.iter)

If you like, other parameters could be adjusted at each step too, such
as the radial resolution or number of iterations in VMEC, the solver
tolerances, or the maximum number of iteration of the optimization
algorithm.

As in the previous section, the final result of this optimization can
be sensitive to small changes in simsopt, VMEC, or the packages they
depend on. Therefore you will not necessarily obtain exactly the
result shown here. But one result produced by this optimization script
is the following configuration:

Bmn objective
-------------

Here we show an alternative method of quasisymmetry optimization using
a different objective function,
:obj:`simsopt.mhd.Quasisymmetry`, based on the
symmetry-breaking Fourier mode aplitudes :math:`B_{m,n}` in Boozer
coordinates.  This example can also be found in the
``examples/2_Intermediate`` directory as
``resolution_increase_boozer.py``.

In this case, the imports needed are::

  from simsopt.util import MpiPartition
  from simsopt.mhd import Vmec, Boozer, Quasisymmetry
  from simsopt.objectives import LeastSquaresProblem
  from simsopt.solve import least_squares_mpi_solve

We again split the pool of MPI processes into worker groups and
initialize a ``Vmec`` object as in the previous example::

  mpi = MpiPartition()
  vmec = Vmec("input.nfp2_QA", mpi=mpi)

This input file, corresponding to an axisymmetric torus with circular
cross-section, can be found in the ``examples/2_Intermediate/inputs``
directory. Next, this alternative quasisymmetry objective can be
created as follows::

  # Configure quasisymmetry objective:
  boozer = Boozer(vmec)
  qs = Quasisymmetry(boozer,
                     0.5, # Radius to target
                     1, 0) # (M, N) you want in |B|

There are several adjustable options, the details of which can be
found in the API documentation for :obj:`~simsopt.mhd.Boozer`
and :obj:`~simsopt.mhd.Quasisymmetry`. The numerical resolution
of the Boozer-coordinate transformation can be adjusted by passing
parameters to the :obj:`~simsopt.mhd.Boozer` constructor, as in
``Boozer(vmec, mpol=64, ntor=32)``. The second argument to
``Quasisymmetry`` above sets the quasisymmetry objective to be
evaluated at normalized toroidal flux of 0.5, but you are free to
provide different values.  Or, a list of values can be provided to
target quasisymmetry on multiple surfaces. The
:obj:`~simsopt.mhd.Quasisymmetry` also has optional arguments
to adjust the normalization and weighting of different Fourier modes.

We now define the total objective function. As with the previous
quasi-axisymmetry example, it is necessary to include a nonzero target
value for the rotational transform in the objective, to prevent the
optimum from being truly axisymmetric. Here we will constrain iota
at the edge and magnetic axis, in order to prescribe the magnetic shear::

  # Define objective function
  prob = LeastSquaresProblem.from_tuples([(vmec.aspect, 6, 1),
                                          (vmec.iota_axis, 0.465, 1),
                                          (vmec.iota_edge, 0.495, 1),
                                          (qs, 0, 1)])

It can be seen here that we are seeking a configuration with aspect
ratio 6, and iota slightly below 0.5.

Now, we set up a loop over several optimization steps. At each step,
the resolution parameters ``mpol`` and ``ntor`` for VMEC increase, as
do the the Fourier resolution parameters for ``booz_xform``. At the
same time, in each optimization step a larger range of poloidal and
toroidal mode numbers are set to be varied in the optimization::

  for step in range(4):
      max_mode = step + 1
    
      # VMEC's mpol & ntor will be 3, 4, 5, 6:
      vmec.indata.mpol = 3 + step
      vmec.indata.ntor = vmec.indata.mpol

      # booz_xform's mpol & ntor will be 16, 24, 32, 40:
      boozer.mpol = 16 + step * 8
      boozer.ntor = boozer.mpol
    
      if mpi.proc0_world:
          print("Beginning optimization with max_mode =", max_mode, \
                ", vmec mpol=ntor=", vmec.indata.mpol, \
                ", boozer mpol=ntor=", boozer.mpol, \
                ". Previous vmec iteration = ", vmec.iter)

      # Define parameter space:
      surf.fix_all()
      surf.fixed_range(mmin=0, mmax=max_mode, 
                       nmin=-max_mode, nmax=max_mode, fixed=False)
      surf.fix("rc(0,0)") # Major radius

      # Carry out the optimization for this step:
      least_squares_mpi_solve(prob, mpi, grad=True)

      if mpi.proc0_world:
          print("Done optimization with max_mode =", max_mode, \
                ". Final vmec iteration = ", vmec.iter)

If you like, other parameters could be adjusted at each step too, such
as the radial resolution or number of iterations in VMEC, the solver
tolerances, or the maximum number of iteration of the optimization
algorithm.

As with the previous examples, the final result of this optimization
can be sensitive to small changes in simsopt, VMEC, or the packages
they depend on. Therefore you will not necessarily obtain exactly the
result shown here. But one result produced by this optimization script
is the following configuration:
