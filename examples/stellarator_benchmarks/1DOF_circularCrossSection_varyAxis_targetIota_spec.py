"""ยก
This script implements the "1DOF_circularCrossSection_varyAxis_targetIota"
example from
https://github.com/landreman/stellopt_scenarios

This example demonstrates optimizing a surface shape using the
Garabedian representation instead of VMEC's RBC/ZBS representation.
This optimization problem has one independent variable, the Garabedian
Delta_{m=1, n=-1} coefficient, representing the helical excursion of
the magnetic axis. The objective function is (iota - iota_target)^2,
where iota is measured on the magnetic axis.

Details of the optimum and a plot of the objective function landscape
can be found here:
https://github.com/landreman/stellopt_scenarios/tree/master/1DOF_circularCrossSection_varyAxis_targetIota
