"""
In this example, we show how the shape of a boundary magnetic
surface can be adjusted to eliminate magnetic islands inside it,
considering a vacuum field. For this example we will use the SPEC code
with a single radial domain. The geometry comes from a quasi-helically
symmetric configuration developed at the University of Wisconsin. We
will eliminate the islands by minimizing an objective function
involving Greene's residue for several O-points and X-points, similar
to the approach of Hanson and Cary (1984).
